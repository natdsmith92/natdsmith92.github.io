			Hello, my name is Nathan and I’m a highly technical, hands-on Software Development Manager with a wealth of knowledge and experience delivering unique, customized applications. I directly support customer and stakeholder initiatives that drive positive change, efficiency, and profitability throughout the organization.

			I also regularly deploy the use of Scrum, Agile, and Waterfall project management methodology to effectively deliver projects on time and within budget/scope. I focus on total customer satisfaction by frequently adjusting resources and budgets to capture technical specifications and requirements for complex projects. I also hone the technical and leadership skills of talented team members through interactive training and on-the-job learning experiences.

			After reviewing my LinkedIn profile and resume, I’m sure you’ll see that my breadth of experience spans many complex projects and large teams. I’m seeking to continue to build my career, knowledge, and skills within the arena of software development and complex technical project management.
